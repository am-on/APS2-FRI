# Peter Puzzle is solving the problem of rod cutting at the steelwork in Jesenice. A rod of integer length n dm is
# possible to cut on integer number of segments. He heard from his nephew, that the problem can be solved using
# dynamic programming.
#
# a) Assume the following prices for various rod lengths:
#
# length (dm)
# 	1 	2 	3 	4 	 5 	 6 	 7 	 8 	 9
# price (EUR)
# 	2   4   7   8   10  11  12 	19 	22
#
# The steelworks began producing rods of length n=7 and they do not know whether they sell rods of the original
# length or they should cut them into smaller segments and sell those separately in order to maximize
# their profit. Compute the optimal segment lengths and the highest possible income.
#
# Compute the optimal segment lengths and incomes, if the steelworks produced rods of length n=8. What about n=9?
